  <p class="text-muted">Kambrya has a dynamic and fast-growing music program led by teacher Mr Adrian Violi and a vibrant team of some of Melbourneâ€™s best specialist instrumentalist teachers. The College boasts a classroom and instrumental music program that caters for a wide variety of instruments and students from beginner to VCE levels covering everything from performance, theory, aural concepts, recording/sound production and composition. In the classroom, students in years 7-9 experience some of the very basics that continue through to the later years. This foundation is essential to the success of any music program and we are thrilled with the progress the students have shown in these areas. Furthermore, the standard of musician at year 9 is very promising indeed as they make their way towards VCE. Our VCE students study the deeper theoretical and performance aspects of Music at an advanced level including musicianship, aural training, practicing with a technical focus and of course, performance. These students are often the ones asked to perform at College events where music is a must.</p>
